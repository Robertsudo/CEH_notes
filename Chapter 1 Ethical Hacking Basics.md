CIA Security Triad = Confidentiality, integrity, availability

# Confidentiality: Confidential (adj). Secret. Private.
Authentication (login forms, using ID:PASS) is the most common way to ensure confidentiality.
Example: MAC spoofing is an authentication attack. 

# Integrity: 
No alteration, no change.
Hashing ensures integrity.
A hash function is a "one-way" mathematical function 
(NOT REVERSIBLE, NOT INVERTIBLE, SINGULAR)
Example hash algorithms: MD5, SHA-1
Example attack sceneario: Bit flipping attack

# Availability: Being available, accessible (adj)
Attacks against availability: DoS = denial of service

# Another triad (triangle) => Security, functionality, ease of use (usability).
Imagine you are at the center of mass of a triangle. When you move up to security, then you necessarily give up from both functionality and usability. 
More secure = Less functional, less usable

# Phases of ethical-hacking
- Reconnaissance (Recon) => Active vs passive
- Scanning and Enumeration => Ping (ICMP) sweeps, network mappers
- Gaining Access
- Escalation of Privileges => From normal user to super user (Sudo, Root, Domain admin)
- Maintaining Access => Adding .ssh backdoor
- Covering Tracks => Removing or altering (changing) log files

# Three types of tests
- Black box testing: Pentesters are given no access at all (no prior knowledge). It stimulates a possible attack from an outside, unknown hacker.
- White box testing:Pentesters are given full access to the system beforehand. It stimulates a possible attack from advanced internal threat, such as sysadmin or network engineer.=> insider threat with elevated privileges
- Gray box testing:Pentesters are given partial, limited access to the system beforehand. It stimulates a possible attack from a regular internal threat, such as a regular employee.
