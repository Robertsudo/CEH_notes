3. Technical support => Calling in technical support and pretending to be a user and request a password reset.
4. Tailgating and piggybacking => An **authorized** employee holds the door open for an **unauthorized** person. Tailgating => we have fake badge. Piggybacking => no badge at all.

Reverse social engineering => Getting the target to call **you** => Do some damage and then lead them to call **you** for help

How to activate express mode?
Press **both** 'Door Close' button **and** the button for your destination floor **at the same time**.
